# Instructions

CSS is a deep well. There's a lot to learn and we're just skimming the surface. This is a great time to practice independent learning.

Play around with the file. Break things. Fix them. Make it ugly. Make it prettier. Have Fun!

If you feel like a challenge, try to add the mobile layout below as the default CSS layout
