# Instructions

Adjust your browser screen width to be as small as possible and imagine how hard it would be to press the submit button on your mobile phone. 

Button default sizes are built for desktops. We need to manually adjust the size to make them more touch friendly. 

Open the `style.css` file and make sure that in the mobile version, the button has a width of 130px and a height of 35px.
