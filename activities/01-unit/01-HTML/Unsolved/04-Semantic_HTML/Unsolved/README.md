# Instructions

In this activity you will make your first website! We will be iterating on the activity to create the website below:

For now we are just adding semantic HTML tags. This will make our code easier to understand, easier for screen readers to interpret, and easier to style (which we'll do next class!)

Follow the steps below:

* Add `nav`, `main`, `aside`, and `section` tags in the appropriate places to make your HTML more semantic. 

* Like the finished product, make sure you have a "Books Quarterly" header at the top of both the left sidebar area and the right main content area. 

* Note: Your layout will look the exact same after this activity.
