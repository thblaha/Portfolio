# Instructions

* First, open `01-HTML` > `style.css`.

* Set the `h1` color to `#666666`

* Set the `a` color to `#666666`

* Set all other font colors to `#434343`

* The background color of our application will be white, so let's move on to the section below to play with backgrounds. 

----

* It's okay if you just complete the first half. After you complete the above, if you have time:

* Inside `07-Color` you'll find a `text.html` document that is already linked to a CSS file. 

* Play around with different background colors. 

* Try adding a gradient.
