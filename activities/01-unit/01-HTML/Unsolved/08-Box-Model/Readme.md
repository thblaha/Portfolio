# Instructions

* Open the css file in `01-HTML`

* Set the `width` of all `img` elements somewhere between `100px` and `150px`.

* add a border to the aside element `aside` with a width of `2px` and the color `#d9d9d9`

* add `10px` of padding to the left and right of the `main` element

* Add margin `0 auto` to the `aside` (This automatically makes a left and right margin which centers the content).
